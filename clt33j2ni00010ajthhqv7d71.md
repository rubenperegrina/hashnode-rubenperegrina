TypeScript has established itself as an essential tool for improving code quality and maintainability. At the beginning, it may appear to be a layer on top of JavaScript, but its benefits extend far beyond that. In this article, we will explore what **TypeScript** is and why you should consider incorporating it into your workflow.

## What is TypeScript?

TypeScript is an additional layer that allows you to write code in your favorite editor. However, once compiled, all TypeScript code is transformed into **pure JavaScript.** This is important because JavaScript engines cannot interpret TypeScript code directly. It has to go through a "pre-translation" process called **compilation**. Only after this stage do you get clean JavaScript code ready to run in a browser. In essence, TypeScript is a special variant of JavaScript that requires a "translator" before execution.

## Why use TypeScript?

The benefits of using TypeScript quickly become apparent, especially when it comes to detecting both serious and minor errors in your code. It also gives your code base a solid structure and makes it almost self-documenting. Improved autocompletion in your editor is just an added benefit.

While there are proponents and detractors, the fact remains that TypeScript is a robust tool that, once mastered, can significantly i**ncrease your productivity and code quality**. In this article, we will explore some of the key benefits that make TypeScript a valuable addition to your development toolkit.

## Advantages of TypeScript:

**1\. Static typing:**

TypeScript provides static typing, allowing you to specify the type of a variable, function parameter, or object property. This helps in detecting errors during compilation, providing more robust code, and preventing runtime issues.

```typescript
let age: number = 25;
let name: string = "Rub√©n";
let isUpdated: boolean = false;
```

**2\. Early error detection:**

Static typing allows TypeScript to detect errors during the compilation process, preventing potential issues before the code runs.

```typescript
let age: number = "Hello"; // Error: Incorrect data type
```

**3\. Enhanced autocompletion:**

TypeScript's type system improves autocompletion in editors, offering more accurate suggestions and reducing development errors.

```typescript
const fruits: string[] = ["Apple", "Banana", "Cherry"];
fruits. // You get autocompletion suggestions
```

**4\. Clear code structuring:**

TypeScript allows you to define clear data types and structures in your code, making it easier to understand and maintain.

```typescript
interface Person {
  name: string;
  age: number;
}
```

**5\. Type inference:**

While type annotations can be added, TypeScript can automatically infer the type of a variable based on its value, making the code more concise.

```typescript
let message = "Hello"; // TypeScript infers that 'message' is of type string
```

**6\. Code maintenance improvement:**

Static typing and clear structures in TypeScript contribute to more maintainable code, making it easier for developers to understand and work on the project.

```typescript
function greet(person: string): string {
  return "Hello, " + person;
}
```

## Conclusion

These benefits demonstrate how TypeScript can improve software development by providing developers with stronger tools for creating robust and efficient code. We will discover more benefits in the next articles.
